## How to Add Your JINZA Logo

The logo placeholder file exists at: `images/jinza-logo.png`

### Steps to Replace with Your Actual Logo:

1. **Save your logo image** with the name `jinza-logo.png`
   - Recommended format: PNG with transparent background
   - Recommended size: 200-400px width, maintaining aspect ratio
   - The image should be the logo you provided (water droplet design)

2. **Replace the file**:
   - Delete or overwrite the current `images/jinza-logo.png`
   - Copy your actual logo file to this location
   - Make sure the filename is exactly: `jinza-logo.png`

3. **Refresh your browser** (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R) to see the changes

### Current Logo Settings:
- **Navigation bar**: Height 60px (desktop), 50px (tablet), 45px (mobile)
- **Footer**: Height 60px
- **Effect**: Scales up 5% on hover in navigation

### If logo still doesn't show:
1. Check that the file is named exactly `jinza-logo.png` (case-sensitive)
2. Make sure it's in the `images` folder
3. Try opening the file directly in browser: `file:///C:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/jinza%20web/images/jinza-logo.png`
4. Check browser console (F12) for any error messages

### Alternative Method:
If you have the logo in a different format or name, you can:
1. Keep your filename (e.g., `jinza-logo.jpg`)
2. Update the HTML to reference your filename
3. Search and replace `jinza-logo.png` with your filename in `index.html`
